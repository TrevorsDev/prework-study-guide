# Study Guide Webpage
# Bootcamp Study Guide Providing Key Notes on Using Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Description

 This prework project was built with the intension of learning how to use Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the first time. All the while it keeps track of important notes that I, or anyone else in need could refer to when working with these tools. It was designed to be simple to understand and clear in its presentation. It should provide sufficient notes covering all the topics that were used to create this project. Additional notes were also added as interest in these subjects grew. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

The study guide itself acts as a Table of Contents with key subject material being presented in individual boxes. I will consider creating a table of contents in some fassion when the notes get long and subheadings are added to separate various topics related to the main areas of study.

## Installation

For this project there is nothing to install. All that is needed is the URL and a search engine.

## Usage

When visiting the webpage, you will see that you're instructed to open the console so that you can view that the JavaScript for this page is running. The running JavaScript will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. Below that, there are four boxes separating notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Within the boxes, these notes are further broken down into into bulleted lists to keep track of related information.

The Console:
 Opening the console provides you with a headings list of what I learned during this Prework activity. On the last line in the console, each time you refresh the page you'll notice that a random topic is chosen for you to study. 
 You can open this console by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "inspect" on the window that drops down from the cursor. Another window will open on the side, or bottom of the webpage and will present a list of headings named "Elements, Console, Sources,... etc. Choose console to view the above details.


Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Credits

I didnt collaborate with anyone on this project, and all of the credit should go to the bootcamp that provided the instructions to guide me in creating this study guide. EDX through the ASU.
