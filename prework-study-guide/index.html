          <li>In Git, a commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the codebase at a specific point in time. A commit is a permanent and unchangeable record of the changes made to the codebase. A commit represents a single point in the history of the codebase.A stage, on the other hand, is a temporary holding area for changes that have been made to the codebase, but have not yet been committed. When you stage changes in Git, you are preparing them for a commit, but you have not yet made the commit. This allows you to review your changes and make sure they are correct before committing them.You can think of a commit as a final version of the changes and a stage as a draft version of the changes.</li>
